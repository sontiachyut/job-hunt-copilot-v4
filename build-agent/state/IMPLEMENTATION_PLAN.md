# Implementation Plan

This plan translates `prd/spec.md` and `prd/test-spec.feature` into the next build program for the specialist-engineer loop.

It should stay aligned with:
- `prd/spec.md`
- `prd/test-spec.feature`
- `build-agent/state/build-board.yaml`

## Current Planning Result

- `BA-00` is complete: the build is now sequenced by phases, dependencies, and bounded slices instead of the original seeded checklist.
- `BA-01-S1` is complete: the repository now has a real `job_hunt_copilot` bootstrap package, runtime support-directory creation, secret-file materialization, and a SQLite migration entrypoint for `job_hunt_copilot.db`.
- `BA-01-S2` is complete: the canonical next-build schema, minimum index set, review views, and shared record-ID/timestamp helpers now initialize cleanly through the migration framework.
- The shared artifact-contract helpers and broader product runtime components are still pending.
- Known operational risk: unattended build-lead execution needs a follow-up validation pass for the `codex exec` CLI compatibility fix already present in the worktree.

## Phase Order

1. Planning and build-loop readiness
   - `BA-00` Planning and decomposition

     - `BA-06-S3` Structured edit generation and finalize verification
     - `BA-06-S4` Mandatory agent review and override handling
5. Outreach execution
   - `BA-07` People search and discovery
     - `BA-07-S1` Apollo search and shortlist materialization
     - `BA-07-S2` Contact enrichment and recipient profiles
     - `BA-07-S3` Email discovery cascade and budget tracking
   - `BA-08` Drafting and sending
     - `BA-08-S1` Send-set readiness and pacing selection
     - `BA-08-S2` Draft generation and artifact persistence
     - `BA-08-S3` Send execution and repeat-outreach guardrails
   - `BA-09` Delivery feedback and review surfaces
     - `BA-09-S1` Feedback event ingestion and observation windows
     - `BA-09-S2` Review queries and traceability surfaces
     - `BA-09-S3` Feedback reuse and reply-safe handling
6. Validation and hardening
   - `BA-10` Validation and hardening
     - `BA-10-S1` Acceptance trace matrix
     - `BA-10-S2` Smoke harness and fixtures
     - `BA-10-S3` Cross-component regression and blocker burn-down

## Dependency Notes

- `BA-01` must land before any component can publish canonical state or `artifact_records`.
- `BA-02` and `BA-03` depend on `BA-01` because supervisor state, runtime packs, and helper entrypoints all need stable schema and bootstrap helpers.
- `BA-04` establishes the shared lead workspace conventions that `BA-05` reuses for autonomous Gmail intake.
- `BA-06` depends on canonical postings plus persisted `jd.md` artifacts from ingestion.
- `BA-07` and `BA-08` depend on agent-approved tailoring state and canonical posting-contact relationships.
- `BA-09` depends on canonical messages from `BA-08` plus review-packet and incident surfaces from `BA-02`.
- `BA-10` closes the loop with acceptance traceability, smoke coverage, and blocker confirmation after the main component boundaries exist.

## Next Slice

- Current focus: `BA-01-S3` Artifact contract and registry utilities.
- Why next: the canonical schema is now in place, and downstream components need shared contract-envelope writers plus `artifact_records` registration helpers before they can publish machine handoff artifacts consistently.
- Done when:
  - shared YAML and JSON contract writers emit the common `contract_version`, `produced_at`, `producer_component`, `result`, `reason_code`, and `message` envelope fields
  - artifact registration helpers can persist `artifact_records` linked to `lead_id`, `job_posting_id`, `contact_id`, or `outreach_message_id`
  - downstream slices can reuse canonical artifact path and reference helpers instead of open-coding metadata writes

## Working Rules

- Break large items into bounded slices before implementation.
- Prefer one primary slice per unattended build session.
- Mark completed slices clearly and keep the board and plan in sync.
- Record blockers explicitly rather than silently skipping them.
